# How to Use 
📦 Description:

  This is a simple widget that can be embedded in platforms like Notion. Easy to set up and customize! ✨
  
  To configure the widget for your D-Day countdown, you'll need to modify the code and then embed it. If you'd like to use it for someone else, simply **duplicate the code and make your edits**. ✍️
  

🛠️ Date Setting:
  
  Adjust the 'DDAY_DATE' variable to set the date for your D-Day (the target date for the countdown).
  
  Replace "2026-01-01" with the date you want in the format "YYYY-MM-DD". 🗓️
    
🛠️ Color Settings:
  TEXT_COLOR: Choose your desired color for the text by replacing the hex code `#000000` with the hex code of your preferred color. 🎨
  
  BG_COLOR: Set the background color by replacing `#ffffff` with the hex code of your choice. 🌈
